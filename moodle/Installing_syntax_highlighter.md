# Syntax highlighter
***
This is a filter plugin that uses a 3rd party Javascript module called highlight.js to make your code look like something 
you'd see in an IDE.

Once activated, you just need to wrap your code in: <pre><code>code</code></pre> or wrap your code in triple backticks 
(like MarkDown) ``` and the javascript will style it.The settings allows you to choose which style to use.

## How to install
